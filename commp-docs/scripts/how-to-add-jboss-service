1) Add a shell script named jboss(Already exists in this directory /scripts/jboss) in the following path /etc/init.d
2) As we know, it is strictly not recommended to run any application server with root user.
    This avoids many problems. For this we will create the user to run the jboss server.

    useradd jboss

3) Use the same user while starting/stopping the server
4) Should give execute permissions to the script:

       chmod +x /etc/init.d/jboss
